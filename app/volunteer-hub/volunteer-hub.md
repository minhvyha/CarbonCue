# Events Tab
I used the information given in the VolunteerConnect's API. Each event include:
- A name/ title
- Duration of the volunteer activity/ event
- Name of the organizer
- Number of attendees (update in real time)
- An image of the volunteer activity/ event
- A button that contains the link to that event on the website 
With these information, I design an event card that contained all of this information and display them with the grid layout for the 'Events' tab

# Organization Tab
For each organization, the information being included are:
- Name 
- Logo 
- Button with link to that specific organisation
The Organisation Card follow the same UI design principles with the Event Card, but since they have differences in terms of the content they represent, I make some changes so that the information displayed are different while the design still stayed the same.
